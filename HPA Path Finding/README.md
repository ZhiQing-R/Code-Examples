# Hierarchical Pathfinding Astar
###
Designed and implemented during an internship. This is an efficient path-finding solusion for grid map. It can support different walking units like flying unit, land unit and water unit. Finally achieved a five times performance enhancement on computation time compared with the original astar path-finding.
I attached some photos used in my report to help illustrate the logic of the system.
